# Shifting an Array
The shift() method removes the first element from an array and returns that removed element. This method changes the length of the array.


## Challenge
The challenge is to insert a new element into a an array while shifting it to the middle of the array without using any of the array built-in methods. 
## Approach & Efficiency
Still a work in progress, I started by breaking the project down into two chuncks, the insertion of a new element, and the shifting od that element to the middle of the array. So I started working  insert a new element into the array. So far I have been able to do this, but is currently not changing the length of the array so it is instead inserting a new element at the end of the array, while deleting the first element, thus keeping the length the same.
